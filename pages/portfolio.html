              AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They
              have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due
              to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective
              decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market
              share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a
              strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to
              incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their
              market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house
              data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their revenue management team had decided to hire a 3rd party
              service provider to provide them with insights from their
              historical data.
